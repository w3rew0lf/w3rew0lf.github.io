Hi, I’m Bhav Goyal. I work as a Security Analyst and have a passion for exploring how technology can be both protected and tested. My main interests lie in Hardware Security, OT (Operational Technology) security, Application Security (AppSec), and Offensive Security Testing.

I’ve always been curious about how things work—especially how they can be broken and made stronger. Over time, this curiosity has driven me to dive deep into securing not only software and networks but also physical systems and critical infrastructure.

In this blog, I share my experiences and thoughts on the latest in security, from vulnerabilities and hacking techniques to practical tips on defense. I hope you find something useful here, and I’d love to connect and chat about all things cybersecurity.
